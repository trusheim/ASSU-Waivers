#Student Fee Waivers Website#
*For the Associated Students of Stanford University*


##About##

Every quarter, students at Stanford are assessed a "Student Activities Fee" that is distributed to the student
government (the ASSU), which then distributes it to student groups and people of that sort. The ASSU also allows
students to waive individual components of that fee if a student objects to a group, finds the fee to be excessive,
etc.

This website enables the refunds process for each student. Key features:
    - WebAuth protection for all areas; admin panel, waiver requests, etc (using my trusheim/webauth project)
    - Follows requirements (set by ASSU Joint Bylaws) that every student can request a waiver of each fee,
    or any part thereof
    - Follows Stanford regulations that some students (e.g. students w/ NCAA scholarship) cannot waive any fees.
    - Export to formats that everyone cares about (CSV)
    - API for other apps to integrate: see if a student has refunded a fee or not.
    - Reasonably good documentation (working on API docs.)
