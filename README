Student Fee Waivers Website
Associated Students of Stanford University / Stanford Student Enterprises
------
ABOUT:

Every quarter, students at Stanford are assessed a "Student Activities Fee" that is distributed to the
student government (the ASSU), which then distributes it to student groups and people of that sort.
The ASSU also allows students to waive individual components of that fee if a student objects to a group,
finds the fee to be excessive, etc.

This website enables the refunds process for each student. Key features:
    - WebAuth protection for all areas; admin panel, waiver requests, etc.
    - Follows requirements (set by ASSU Joint Bylaws) that every student can request a waiver of
      each fee, or any part thereof
    - Follows Stanford regulations that some students (e.g. students w/ NCAA scholarship) cannot waive
      any fees.
    - Export to formats that everyone cares about (CSV, and the PRN format that SSC uses)
    - API for other apps to integrate: see if a student has refunded a fee or not.
